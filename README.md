Data Recovery in unconfirmed LoRaWAN frame transmission using forward error correction
=====================================
This code is in beta phase and is not properly documented yet!

Introduction
----------------

The aim of this project is to show the encoder and decoder of DaRe Code for LoRaWAN.
To implement DaRe Code, use one of the example projects.

Example projects:

1. [DaRe Code for Sodaq Mbili](https://github.com/maerduq/dare-code-for-sodaq-mbili)


Context
-------------------
This project is a result of a Master Thesis at Delft University of Technology. The research has also been published in the 2nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation (IoTDI 2017) and was awarded Best Paper Runner-up.

Documents:
* [Master Thesis | Frame Loss Characterisation and Data Erasure Coding for LoRaWAN](http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A78c5e6ea-d34b-498d-b723-9b45d7998480)
* [Paper | DaRe: Data Recovery through Application Layer Coding for LoRaWAN](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3054978) (also listed [here](http://www.es.ewi.tudelft.nl/publications.php))

Usage
---------
* You will be needing Microsoft Visual Studio. [Free version here](https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&telem=ga)
* Open `DaReCodingEmulation.sln` with Visual Studio
* Compile and run `main.cpp` for simulations
